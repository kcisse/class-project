HTML tags : HTML documents are described by HTML tags. Each HTML tag describes different content element in a document. Here are some examples:

- The text between `<html> and </html>` describes an HTML document
- The text between `<head> and </head>` provides information about the document The text between `<title> and </title>` provides a title for the document
- The text between `<body> and </body>` describes the visible page content
- The text between `<h1> and </h1>` describes a heading
- The text between `<p> and </p>` describes a paragraph

## CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it represents the design conventions that are applied to the display of HTML elements on screen, paper and other media.

CSS syntax is expressed in the form of a rule-set consisting of a selector and a declaration box. Colors are specified using pre-defined color names. CSS can be added to HTML elements in three ways: inline, internal and external.

### Sample Code

```
body {
    background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
}
p {
    font-family: Verdana;
    font-size: 20px;
}
```

#### Colors Tutorial

[CSS Color Values](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/default.asp) - With CSS, colors can be specified in different ways:

By color names

- As RGB values
- As hexadecimal values
- As HSL values (CSS3)
- As HWB values (CSS4)
- With the `currentcolor` keyword

    font-size: 20px;
}
